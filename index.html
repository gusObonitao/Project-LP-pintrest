               are circular and collapsable.

                The perfect example of circular furniture products is the LJ series. <br>
                The attractive series of chairs and stools have a metal frame and <br>
                a seat made of recycled PET bottles. These components are <br>
                upcycled already but also easily dismantled and recycled again. <br><br><br>
                LJ 1 is a generous armchair, recognised by its slim lines and multi- <br>
                functional desing. The chair provides an ergonomically curved <br>
                seat and back support for outstanding seating experience. LJ 1 is <br>
                made from PET Felt and recycled-strength steel, making it a <br>
                durable and sustainable piece of furniture.
