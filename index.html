                    Circularity has been an integral part of the desing in many <br>
                    ways: respecting the majority of the existing constructions, <br>
                    using waste wood for the facades, reusing the concrete from <br>
                    the parts which were demolished, reusing the steel <br>
                    construction for the extensions of the buildings.

                    A handcrafted piece with beautiful detailling. Clip chair <br>

                    modern materials, making it a timeless piece of wooden <br>
                    furniture with a variety of bespoke options. The chair is <br>
                    recognised by its distinctive feature - the 'clip', attaching <br>
                    the back of the chair to its frame. Coloured in black, this <br>
                    small detail stands in direct contrast to the wooden <br>
                    elements.
